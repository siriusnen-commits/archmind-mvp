# ArchMind – Prompt to Architecture Generator

## What is this?
ArchMind is a lightweight tool that transforms natural language ideas
into practical, developer-ready software architecture.

## Why?
Many ideas fail not because they are bad,
but because they never become executable structures.

## Current Status
🚧 MVP in progress
- Input: Natural language idea
- Output: Architecture outline + project skeleton

## Roadmap
- [ ] Core prompt design
- [ ] Architecture output format
- [ ] Code skeleton generation
